# File name: chestQuest.py
# Description:
# - Goal is to find treasure chests on an island
# - "hot", "cold", "warm" give hints about where next chest is
# - chests are the easiest to get and abundant source of gold
# - Different weather conditions effect how much the energy is decreased
# - moving around consumes certain amount of health depending on distance
# - healstones increase health but cost 140 gold
# - wheels offer a random prize such as health, decreased energy consumption
# for 10 seconds, and money
# - level resets every 60 seconds - location of wheels, healstones and chests
# changes
# 600 x 600 px screen
